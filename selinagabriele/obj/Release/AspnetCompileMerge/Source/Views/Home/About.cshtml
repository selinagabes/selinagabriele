                    I'm not going to lie, <code>About Me</code>s are super difficult to write. How do you effectively protray yourself in two small paragraphs?
                    I mean I'd like you to know that I'm a hard worker, that I'm passionate about my projects, and am confident that I can
                    overcome any challenge. However, I don't want to use cheesy clichés or over-wordy sentences, plus I want to sound clever.
                    If you've ever written one of these, you're either good with words and wrote this thing with ease, or you sat there for 
                    hours, read so many <code>About Me</code>s, and carefully constructed your sentences, without ever really being satisfied.

                    So here is my deal, I currently do research at the University of Windsor (Check out resume for more info). I love what I do
                    and think that Computer Science is the field of the future. I like to be challenged, I attack my work with grit, I am a quick learner,
                    an effective communicator and not good at writing <code>About Me</code>s.

                <p class="text-about">
                   Some of my fascinations include Network Security, Health Care applications and Mathematics.
                   Some things I'm good at are napping, finding good music on Spotify, and writing solid code.
                   I'm proud to be in a field that influences so many sectors, and am interested in being involved in any stimulating project.
